# Adaptive Mutation and Payoff Dynamics in Finite Populations

This repository contains the code and analysis for my undergraduate honors thesis on dynamic mutation rates in evolutionary game theory.
The project explores exponential, logistic, and threshold mutation models under fixed and adaptive payoff structures.

## Features
- Moran process simulation with dynamic mutation rates
- Fixed vs. adaptive payoff structures
- Confidence interval estimation from multiple replicates
- Entropy and variance tracking over time
- Automated plotting of key results

## Project Structure
- `src/` – Simulation, analysis, and plotting code
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebook with narrative and figures
- `examples/` – Quickstart scripts to reproduce results
- `tests/` – Unit tests

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/dynamic-mutation-rates.git
cd dynamic-mutation-rates
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python examples/run_demo.py
